AutoSignon Authentication Provider for Blackboard
================

This Authentication provider is meant to replace the old (Legacy Authentication) AutoSignon Building Block which was originally written
by Blackboard Global Services, and made available on Github.

This Auth Provider was contributed to the community by Swinburne University, and is now maintained by
All the Ducks Pty Ltd.
